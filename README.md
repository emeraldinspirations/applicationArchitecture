# applicationArchitecture
> A PHP implementation of the Architecture design by Uncle Bob

[Uncle Bob Martin](http://cleancoder.com) presents a software architecture
pattern which moves the business logic front-and-center; and the framework,
database, and delivery methods as plug-ins.  This project contains both a
diagram of an implementation of this architecture, a sample directory
structure, as well as the interfaces needed to implement this architecture in a
future project.
