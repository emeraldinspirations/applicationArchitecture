===============

Request to the application

A Request Model is an array object containing all the parameters for the
request to the application.  It is "delivery mechanism agnostic" i.e. it
contains absolutely no information about the web or the command line or
whatever interface is being used.  It is also locale and language agnostic,
containing only value objects and strings.
