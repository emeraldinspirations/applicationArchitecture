===============

The response from application

A Response Model is an array object containing the response from the
application.  It is "delivery mechanism agnostic" i.e. it is not specific to
the web or the command line or whatever interface is being used.  It is also
locale and language agnostic, containing value objects that are later
converted into human-readable information.
